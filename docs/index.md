# HMAX documentation

Welcome to the HMAX documentation (version Renoult et al. 2019).

For instructions about how to install the MATLAB package, go [here](/installation/).  
If you have already downloaded the package, go [here](/get-started/) to start using it.

## What is HMAX?

HMAX is a computational model of information processing in the *ventral pathway* of the visal cortex, which is involved in colour and shape perception. The model was developped by Riesenhuber & Poggio (1999).

## What is new in this version of HMAX?

This version of HMAX offers high flexibility in parameter setting and thus can be easily tuned to model the perception of colour patterns in a wide array of Vertebrate species. Furthermore, it is possible to learn filters (i.e. neuronal selectivities) using a sparseness constraint, or to force sparseness when coding an image with a given set of filters. As in the version proposed by Zhang et al. (2012), it can process greyscale or colour images; however, it is up to 25% faster. Renoult et al. (2019) provides a complete description of the model.

## What is HMAX ?

HMAX is a computational model based on what is called the *ventral-dorsal model* in the visal cortex in neurosciences. This model is meant to be biolocically plausible.

## What are the difference with the original HMAX ?

Our implementation include color, sparse coding, parallel computing and GPU computing.

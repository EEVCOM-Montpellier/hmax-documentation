# HMAX documentation

Welcome to the documentation of HMAX version Renoult et al. 2009.

For instructions about how to install the package, go [here](/installation/).  
If you have already downloaded it, you can directly go [there](/get-started/).

## What is HMAX?

HMAX is a computational model of information processing in the *ventral pathway* of the visal cortex, which is involved in colour and shape perception. The model was developped by Riesenhuber & Poggio (*Nature Neuroscience*, 1999) 

## What is original in this version of HMAX?

Our implementation of HMAX offers high flexibility in parameters setting and thus can be easily adapted to model the perception of colour patterns in a wide array of Vertebrate species. It can be used to process greyscale or colour images as in the verison proposed by Zhang et al (*ECCV*, 2012), and comes (optionally) with a sparse coding scheme that optimizes efficiency in information processing.

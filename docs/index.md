# HMAX documentation

Welcome to the HMAX documentation (version Renoult et al. 2019).

For instructions about how to install the MATLAB package, go [here](/installation/).  
If you have already downloaded the package, go [here](/get-started/) to start using it.

## What is HMAX?

HMAX is a computational model of information processing in the *ventral pathway* of the visal cortex, which is involved in colour and shape perception. The model was proposed originally by Riesenhuber & Poggio (1999).

## What is new in this version?

This version of HMAX offers high flexibility in parameter setting and thus can be easily tuned to model the perception of colour patterns in a wide array of Vertebrate species. This package also includes sparse-HMAX, an extension of HMAX with a sparse coding scheme, as an attempts to make the model even more biologically realistic and to provide a tool for estimating efficiency in information processing. As in the version proposed by Zhang et al. (2012), it can process greyscale or colour images; however, it is up to 25% faster. Renoult et al. (2019) provides a complete description of the model.
